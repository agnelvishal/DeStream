# DeStreams : Decentralized video streaming

DeStreams is a decentralized video streaming application using modern WebRTC, [GunDB](http://gun.eco) , [MediaSoup](https://mediasoup.org/) and [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) to produce a hybrid MESH-SFU with strong privacy, zero user data retention and powerful off-grid capabilities.

Try it at https://destreams.zil using [Unstoppable Domains extension](https://unstoppabledomains.com/extension)
